        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focused on designing a front-facing static user portal for engineers, analysts, program managers, and leadership. Its primary objective was to consolidate information, documentation, communication, resources, and updates into a single, accessible location. <br>
           The effort supported key organizational goals by improving operational efficiency, reducing support overhead, and establishing a dependable source of truth across teams. I identified the core issues by uncovering communication gaps, outdated resources, and a lack of clear points of contact for various requests. <br>
           Through user conversations and research, I mapped out chokepoints and defined a path toward a unified solution. The portal quickly became a widely used destination for accurate information, Tier 1 helpdesk support, and streamlined communication.
           The project operated under significant technical and resource constraints, as I was responsible for the full UX lifecycle—including research, wireframing, design, testing, and front-end development. <br>
           Delivered within a 12-week window, the work involved close collaboration with various users and stakeholders, while cross-functional partners ensured compliance and security requirements were met. Despite the limitations, the portal provided measurable value and improved clarity, accessibility, and operational flow across the organization.

      <section id="problem" class="case-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Multiple teams were working toward the same overarching goal but lacked a reliable, unified source of truth. Critical project requirements were not being communicated accurately or consistently, leading to widespread confusion across engineering and stakeholder groups. With information scattered across Teams, Slack, email, and various platforms—some of which certain users couldn’t access—there was no dependable location to consult for up-to-date documentation, project status, or key decisions. Teams also had no visibility into each other’s work, causing duplicated efforts and unintentional overlap. Service requests were sent informally through chats and emails, making them difficult to track, prioritize, or resolve efficiently. Together, these issues created significant delays in development, slowed decision-making, and increased operational friction.<br>
           The need for unification became urgent as frustrations continued to escalate across users, teams, and stakeholders. Quarterly PI Planning events repeatedly highlighted major chokepoints, with teams struggling to clarify their roles, responsibilities, and cross-team dependencies. Confusion routinely overshadowed these planning sessions, limiting meaningful progress and exposing the lack of a centralized location for accurate, validated information. Although updates were being shared, there was no structured home for them, making alignment increasingly difficult.<br>
           Without addressing this problem, teams would continue to operate in confusion, with severe overlap in responsibilities and increasing duplication of work. The ongoing absence of a shared source of truth would further diminish visibility into the overall mission, leaving users uncertain about where to communicate or which information to trust. Over time, these gaps would widen, slowing progress, increasing operational risk, and making coordinated development nearly impossible.<br>
           After launch, the portal demonstrated clear and measurable impact. It now receives more than 200 visits per day as users search for information, verify system status, and access authoritative links. Service desk submissions increased from zero to an average of 35 tickets per day, creating a reliable, trackable channel for support. Communication methods were consolidated from four platforms into one, greatly reducing coordination time. Users reported saving 20–30 minutes per task, with information searches now taking as little as two minutes—reflecting significant gains in clarity, efficiency, and alignment across the organization.<br>
