        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Designed a front-facing static user portal for engineers, analysts, program managers, and leadership. The portal consolidates documentation, system status, communications, and service requests into a single, accessible entry point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Led the full UX lifecycle—research, information architecture, wireframes, prototypes, usability testing, and front-end implementation—within a 12-week window. Cross-functional partners supported compliance and security alignment, while I focused on clarity, findability, and adoption.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="problem" class="case-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Multiple teams were working toward the same goal but had no unified source of truth. Information lived across Teams, Slack, email, and scattered documentation sites, with no clear ownership or version control.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No reliable place to confirm requirements, system status, or decisions.</li>
          <li>Duplicated work and overlapping efforts between teams.</li>
          <li>Service requests sent via ad-hoc chats and emails with no tracking.</li>
          <li>PI Planning events repeatedly surfaced confusion around roles, responsibilities, and cross-team dependencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Without a central hub, confusion, delays, and operational risk would continue to grow as more teams joined the effort.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="process" class="case-section">
        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Interviewed engineers, stakeholders, and leadership to understand information needs and communication patterns.</li>
          <li>Ran short surveys to validate assumptions at scale.</li>
          <li>Audited existing documentation and observed PI Planning sessions to identify gaps, overlaps, and bottlenecks.</li>
          <li>Key insight: there was no standardized way to document, discover, or update critical information, and no clear path for requesting support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Used Mural to cluster pain points into themes that directly mapped to portal content (features, links, status, support).</li>
          <li>Explored multiple IA options to align with how users naturally search for information.</li>
          <li>Created low-fidelity wireframes and an interactive prototype to quickly validate structure and navigation with users and stakeholders.</li>
          <li>For the MVP, chose a centralized static portal that automatically opens as the primary entry point when users log in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ran usability tests and feedback sessions with cross-functional teams.</li>
          <li>Users strongly favored the clear structure, predictable navigation, and single place to start their day.</li>
          <li>Feature requests (e.g., more advanced modules and deeper integrations) were captured and prioritized into a backlog for future iterations due to MVP scope and timeline.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="solution" class="case-section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The final solution is a centralized, front-facing user portal that serves as the single source of truth for project information, system status, and support.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single entry point:</strong> Portal auto-launches on login, establishing a consistent starting place for all users.</li>
          <li><strong>Organized content:</strong> Clear sections for documentation, system status, updates, and key links based on user mental models.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrated support:</strong> Built-in service desk entry to replace untracked chat and email requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalable framework:</strong> Structure designed to easily add new features and content as needs evolve.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="impact" class="case-section">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>200+ portal visits per day for system status, documentation, and key resources.</li>
          <li>Service desk requests grew from 0 to ~35 tickets per day with clear tracking and ownership.</li>
          <li>Communication consolidated from four platforms into one primary channel.</li>
          <li>Time to find information dropped from ~20–30 minutes to about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Improved cross-team visibility reduced duplicated effort and confusion around roles and responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="reflection" class="case-section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What I’d do next:</strong> Add role-based personalization, deeper integrations with service management tools, and analytics dashboards to continuously optimize content and navigation.</li>
          <li><strong>Tradeoffs and constraints:</strong> A 12-week timeline and single-designer model meant focusing on core value first and deferring advanced features to future releases.</li>
          <li><strong>What I learned:</strong> Centralizing information and clarifying ownership can be just as impactful as new features. Tight, end-to-end execution under constraints reinforced the value of prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and iterative delivery.</li>
        </ul>
