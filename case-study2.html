      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section id="overview" class="case-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the onboarding experience for contractor personnel and new platform users. The goal was to streamline operations, reduce manual work, and enable a faster, more accurate onboarding flow with minimal human intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effort was shaped by limited permissions, platform constraints, and fragmented environments. Despite these challenges, I led end-to-end research, workflow analysis, IA, automation design, and implementation across Jira Service Desk and a supporting static site.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- PROBLEM -->
      <section id="problem" class="case-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The onboarding process was slow, unclear, and heavily manual.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outdated and redundant paperwork; unclear instructions.</li>
          <li>Users didn’t know what forms applied to them or where to submit them.</li>
          <li>Internal teams lacked defined requirements for each user type.</li>
          <li>No centralized hub, no tracking, no standardized communication.</li>
          <li>Access requests required multiple handoffs with no structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Onboarding took <strong>2–3 weeks</strong>, required <strong>15 manual steps</strong>, and demanded <strong>3–4 hours</strong> of internal team time per user. With 27+ new users per month, the process was no longer sustainable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- PROCESS -->
      <section id="process" class="case-section">
        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Interviewed internal teams to understand constraints and workflow gaps.</li>
          <li>Interviewed recently onboarded users to capture pain points.</li>
          <li>Shadowed onboarding sessions and conducted a self-onboarding walkthrough.</li>
          <li>Mapped paperwork requirements and analyzed every touchpoint.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paperwork requirements were unclear and inconsistent by role.</li>
          <li>Users did not know where to submit documentation or what steps came next.</li>
          <li>Internal teams lacked checklists, workflows, and entitlement clarity.</li>
          <li>Sensitive information was sent via insecure or inconsistent channels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mapped current-state and future-state processes end-to-end.</li>
          <li>Identified microprocesses for automation and simplification.</li>
          <li>Created standardized checklists integrated into Jira Service Desk.</li>
          <li>Designed role-based pathways and automated routing triggers.</li>
          <li>Developed supporting static site for delivering accurate, role-specific instructions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tested the new flow with recently onboarded users through surveys and walkthroughs.</li>
          <li>Ran internal scenarios to validate role-based logic and entitlement routing.</li>
          <li>Platform teams confirmed they finally received complete, accurate information upfront.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- SOLUTION -->
      <section id="solution" class="case-section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          A role-based, automated onboarding system combining Jira Service Desk workflows with a centralized static information site. The solution removed unnecessary steps, improved clarity, and reduced dependency on manual coordination.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Centralized onboarding hub</li>
          <li>Role-based pathways and instructions</li>
          <li>Automated triggers and confirmations</li>
          <li>Standardized digital forms</li>
          <li>Secure upload workflow</li>
          <li>Internal team checklists in Jira</li>
          <li>Automated entitlement routing</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- IMPACT -->
      <section id="impact" class="case-section">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Onboarding time reduced from 2–3 weeks to ~2 days.</strong></li>
          <li>Emails reduced from 7 per user to just 2 (intro + confirmation).</li>
          <li>Manual steps reduced from 15 to 4.</li>
          <li>Internal entitlement teams received accurate role-based info upfront.</li>
          <li>Users reported extremely high satisfaction through follow-up surveys.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- REFLECTION -->
      <section id="reflection" class="case-section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What I’d do next:</strong> Integrate agentic AI to answer user questions, detect onboarding events, route forms automatically, and guide onboarding inside the platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> Permissions limitations, environment constraints, and dependency on internal team workflows shaped the scope of this MVP.</li>
          <li><strong>What I learned:</strong> Onboarding defines the first impression. Clear workflows, automation, and role-based logic dramatically improve speed, accuracy, and user confidence.</li>
        </ul>
